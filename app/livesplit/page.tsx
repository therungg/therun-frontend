                    If your splits do not get uploaded or your runs do not show
                    on the live page, here is what you can try:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Verify that the Game and Category fields have been set
                        in LiveSplit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that you added the therun.gg layout from the
                        Other tab to your layout in LiveSplit.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
