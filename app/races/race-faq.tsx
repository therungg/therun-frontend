                            The races on therun.gg integrate seamlessly with the
                            therun.gg LiveSplit component. If you already use
                            it. You are good to go! Just log in with Twitch in
                            the top right corner and you are all set. If you do
                            not use the component yet, checkout{" "}

                            you want to use those. Feel free to ignore them,

                            The race will automatically start with a countdown
                            once every participant has indicated they are ready
                            to go. To indicate this, hit the huge green button

                        <h5>1. Run your game</h5>
                        <p>
                            Since you have your therun.gg LiveSplit Component
                            setup, you can just start your run as you are used
                            to. The site will automatically detect your run.
                            While you are running, keep an eye on the race page!
                            It will show your and other participants updates,
                            and compare you all against each other in real-time!
                        </p>
                        <h5>2a. Finish your run</h5>
                        <p>
                            Once you are done, you should be done in LiveSplit
                            as well. Therefore, therun.gg will automatically
                            mark you as Finished. It will also show you your
                            final time. If that time is incorrect, you may
                            insert the correct time and click the Confirm
                            button. If you do not confirm your time manually, it
                            will happen automatically after 10 minutes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you accidentally finish or confirm your time
                            while not meaning to, you can always undo these
                            actions through the race page.

                            Alternatively, it can happen that you are not able
                            (or not willing) to finish your run. If you reset in
                            LiveSplit your run will be automatically marked as
                            Abandoned. If you reset on accident, you can undo
                            your abandon, as long as the race has not finished.

                            When all participants have either confirmed their
                            time, the race will be considered finished. That
                            means you can no longer undo your abandon or adjust
                            your final time. The game statistics will be updated
                            and your rankings will be adjusted according to your
                            performance in the race.

                            The creator of the race can select a button that
                            says Create Successor Race. This will automatically
                            create a new race with the same settings. When the
                            creator did this, all other participants will see a
                            button leading them to the new race!

                        <p>
                            No, you do not have to. You can just join a race,
                            and when you are done, finish up and enter your
                            final time during confirmation.

                        <p>

                            therun.gg LiveSplit Component. It allows

                            someone, you gain rating. If you lose to someone,
                            you lose rating. However, the larger the rating gap,
                            the more you can win or lose.

                            For example: if you have a rating of 1200 and your
                            opponent has a rating of 1900, it is pretty much
                            expected that you lose. If that does indeed happen,
                            you will not lose many rating. If you beat them,
                            however, you will <i>gain</i> a massive amount of
                            rating.

                        <p>
                            You have a seperate rating for every game/category
                            combination. That means your rating is different for
                            Any% than it is for 100%.
