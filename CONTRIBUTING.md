# Contribution Guide

therun.gg's frontend is open source and under active development. There's a lot to be improved so any help is welcome!
This guide gives you an overview of the steps you need to take to contribute to the project.

If you want to contribute to more complicated code, make sure you know about:

-   TypeScript

## Find an issue
